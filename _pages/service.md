<!-- I am enthusiastic about the importance of community support in research and
academia. During my PhD I have worked to foster social bonds and
collaboration within WPIâ€™s Data Science department. An open and supportive
learning environment is invaluable, especially for individuals in demographics
underrepresented in STEM. I have listed a selection of my efforts to enrich
and support the data science community below. -->
