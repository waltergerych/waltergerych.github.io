My research primarily focuses on performign machine learnign on incomplete data, especially in the case where the available data is biased. This includes works on learning from data with partial or missing labels, as well as debiasing datasets that underrepresent certain demographics. I mostly focus on developing rigerous models of the annotation process itself for correcting and debiasing missing labels, and the applying generative modeling to correct for biased data samples.

My work is largely motivated by the development of Human Context Recognition (HCR) systems that identify the *context* (i.e. physical activities and state) of individuals using mobile sensor data. My work on HCR has focused on developing systems that are beneficial to mobile healthcare applications.
